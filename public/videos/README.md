# Video Assets

Place your onboarding video files here:

- `onboarding-1.mp4` - City/travel scenes for the first onboarding screen
- `onboarding-2.mp4` - Video for the second onboarding screen
- `onboarding-3.mp4` - Video for the third onboarding screen

## Video Requirements:

- Format: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
- Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
- Keep file size reasonable (under 10MB per video for good loading performance)
- Duration: 10-30 seconds (videos will loop)

## Free Video Sources:

- [Pexels Videos](https://www.pexels.com/videos/)
- [Pixabay Videos](https://pixabay.com/videos/)
- [Coverr](https://coverr.co/)

## Fallback:

If video files are not available, the app will still work but display a black background. You can also use a static image as a fallback by modifying the VideoBackground component.
